## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Pseudo elements can only be used with block elements. In my first attempt to create the hover effect for the image, I used the ::after element on the image and it didn't show up. Later, I used a div to wrap around my image and used the ::after on the div and it worked!!
- Using background-position to center the eye icon in the middle of the image.
